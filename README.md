A simple and efficient checklist application for creating, managing, and organizing tasks and to-do lists. This appâ€™s goal is to create a platform where a coordinator can delegate tasks to employees, making it easy to understand the workflow and track what everyone is doing at any given moment.

Currently under development.
The code was initially done following this series of tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qBTe6uHJS_Y&list=PL82C6-O4XrHfrGOCPmKmwTO7M0avXyQKc), which i did entirely and am now using this base to develop my application.
